\section{Pull Back Bundle}

Let \(\pi^E : E \to N\) be a smooth, rank \(k\), vector bundle. Given a smooth map \(f : M \to N\), there is a smooth vector bundle, the \emph{pull-back bundle} \(f^{\ast} \pi : f^{\ast}E \to M\) whose sections over an open set \(U  \subset M\) are
\[
\Gamma(U, f^{\ast} E) = \{s : U \to E | \pi^E \circ s = f\}.
\]

Given a section \(s \in \Gamma(V, E)\) of \(E\), we can pull it back to \(f^{\ast} s \in \Gamma(f^{-1}(V), f^{\ast} E)\) whose definition is,
\[
f^{\ast} (x) = s(f(x)), x \in f^{-1}(V).
\]

While it is not true that in general, a local section \(S\) of \(f^{\ast} E\) is equal to a pull-back section \(f^{\ast} s\), it is true that the sections of \(f^{\ast} E\) are \emph{locally generated} by pull-back sections. That is, any open set \(U \subset M\) is covered by sets \(U_{\alpha} = f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\) where \(V_{\alpha}\) trivialise \(E\).

Then for each \(\alpha\), we have a local frame. \(\{s^{\alpha}_i\}_{i=1}^k\) for \(E\) and \(\{f^{\ast} s^{\alpha}_i\}\) generate \(\Gamma(U_{\alpha}, f^{\ast} E\) in that any section \(S \in \Gamma(U_{\alpha}, f^{\ast} E)\) may be written,
\[
S(x) = G^i(x) s^{\alpha}_i(x)
\]
for smooth functions \(G^i \in C^{\infty}(U_{\alpha}, \R)\). It's important to note here that in general, \(G^i \ne f^{\ast} g^i\) for smooth functions \(g^i\) (otherwise we would have \(S = f^{\ast} s\) where \(s = G^i s^{\alpha}_i\).

In the particular case that \(f\) is an immersion, any smooth function \(G : U \to \R\) may be locally extended to \(g : V \to \R\) in the sense that \(G = f^{\ast} g\) along the open set \(f^{-1}(V) \cap U\), but not in general globally. If \(f\) is an embedding, \(G = f^{\ast} g\) for \(g\) a smooth function on a neighbourhood of \(F(M)\). Thus, in the case of an immersion, all sections \(S \in \Gamma(U, f^{\ast} E)\) are locally pull-backs \(S = f^{\ast} s\). For an embedding, all sections \(S \in \Gamma(U, f^{\ast} E)\) are globally pull-backs \(S = f^{\ast} s\). Once more, let us emphasise the point that for a general smooth map, \(f: M \to N\) sections of the pull-back bundle cannot even be written locally as pull-back sections.

\begin{example}
A particular example is the tangent bundle, \(TN \to N\). In this case, we get a bundle map,
\begin{align*}
f_{\ast} : TM &\to f^{\ast} TN \\
X &\mapsto df \cdot X,
\end{align*}
that is,
\[
(f_{\ast} X) (x) = df_{x} \cdot X(x).
\]

As noted above, \(f^{\ast} X\) so defined will not in general be extendable, even locally to a vector field on \(N\), but it does define a section of the pull-back bundle. If \(f\) is an embedding, \(f_{\ast} X\) may extended globally to vector field on a neighbourhood of \(f(M)\), and if \(f\) is an immersion, such an extension is possible locally.

For immersions, by definition \(df_x\) is injective at each \(x\) and so we see that \(f_{\ast}\) is an injective as a bundle map and hence,
\[
f_{\ast} (TM) \hookrightarrow f^{\ast} TN
\]
realises \(TM\) as isomorphic to a sub-bundle of \(f^{\ast} TN\).

The normal bundle \(\nu M\) is defined as the quotient bundle \(f^{\ast} TN/\nu M\) which gives an exact sequence,
\[
0 \to TM \overset{f_{\ast}}{\to} f^{\ast} TN \to \nu M \to 0
\]
of vector bundles

If \(TN\) has a metric, then the metric splits the exact sequence. That is we have the orthogonal decomposition,
\[
f^{\ast} TN \simeq TM \oplus \nu M
\]
and we have an inclusion,
\[
\nu M \to f^{\ast} TN.
\]
\end{example}

\section{Connections on Pull-back Bundles}

Suppose now our vector bundle \(\pi^E : E \to N\) has a connection \(D\). There are a couple of equivalent ways to define the pull back connection \(f^{\ast} D\) on \(f^{\ast} E\). The defining property of the pull-back connection is,
\[
(f^{\ast} D)_X f^{\ast} s = D_{f_{\ast} X} s
\]
for any tangent vector \(X \in TM\). The point now is to show,
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f^{\ast} D\) is well defined,
\item \(f^{\ast} D\) is the unique connection with the above property.
\end{enumerate}
